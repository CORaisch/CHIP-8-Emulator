* TODOs:
** implement graphics backend
*** implement a special class for graphics in its own file
*** use SDL2 codebase (e.g. ~/Projects/SDL2_Test/src/sdl2_window.cpp) as starting point
*** implement macro pixels s.t. small original 64x32 window can be easily zoomed
** implement sound backend
*** implement a special class for sound in its own file (even tho its just a beeper engine)
*** use SDL2 codebase (e.g. ~/Projects/SDL2_Test/src/sdl2_synthesizer.cpp) as starting point
*** normally one does not need to run it in a special thread, should already be managed by SDL2
** verify disassembler results
*** TODO write unit tests
** verify opcode functionality
*** TODO write unit tests
